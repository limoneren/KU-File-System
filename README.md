### Comp 304 Operating Systems - Project 3

This is the third project of the course "Comp 304 - Operating Systems" in spring 2018 semester. In this project, we implemented a file system library which operates on a virtual hard disk. The file system is based on File Allocation Table (FAT), and it consists of only a single directory.

The detailed project description can be found in the project description pdf.
